## Overview

This project is built using **ReactJS** with **Vite** as the build tool. It demonstrates the implementation of fundamental React concepts and efficient data handling using Context API.

## React Fundamental Concepts Used

This project utilizes all fundamental concepts of React, including:

- **JSX:** The syntax extension to JavaScript used for writing HTML elements in React.
- **Components:** Reusable pieces of UI logic encapsulated in JavaScript functions or classes.
- **Props:** Custom attributes passed to components to handle data flow.
- **State:** Local state management within components.

- **Hooks:** Functions like `useState`, `useEffect`, etc., for managing state and side effects in functional components.
- **Event Handling:** Handling user interactions within the UI.
- **Conditional Rendering:** Displaying elements based on conditions.
- **Lists and Keys:** Rendering dynamic lists of elements and maintaining their unique identity.
- **Forms:** Handling form input and submission.
- **Context API:** Managing and passing state more efficiently across the component tree without prop drilling.
